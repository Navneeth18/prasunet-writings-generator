## API Key Rotation

WriteCraft implements API key rotation to prevent hitting rate limits with the Gemini API. The system automatically cycles through 5 different API keys for each request, ensuring continuous service even if some keys reach their quota limits.

To add your own API keys:
1. Get API keys from the [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/)
2. Add them to the `.env` file in the server directory as shown in the Configuration section
